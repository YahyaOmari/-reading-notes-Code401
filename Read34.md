### What is dynamic routing in next JS?

- Defining routes by using predefined paths is not always enough for complex applications. In Next. js you can add brackets to a page ( "[param]" ) to create a dynamic route (a.k.a. url slugs, pretty urls, and others).

### How does next Javascript routing work?

- Next. js has a file-system based router built on the concept of pages. When a file is added to the pages directory it's automatically available as a route. The files inside the pages directory can be used to define most common patterns.

### Where should I deploy next JS?

- The easiest way to deploy Next. js to production is to use the Vercel platform from the creators of Next. js. Vercel is a cloud platform for static sites, hybrid apps, and Serverless Functions.

### Is next JS frontend or backend?

- Yes. Next. js is a pre-rendered React app in the client-side that users can view and interact with and can be considered as front-end. At the same time, it also does server-side rendering and API routes which can perform server-side code and access data in the database and can be considered as back-end.
