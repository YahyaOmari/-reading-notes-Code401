# Web Scraping

## What is web scraping?

- Web scraping generally is the process of extracting data from the web, you can analyze the data and extract useful information.

- Also, you can store the scraped data in a database or any kind of tabular format such as CSV, XLS, etc., so you can access that information easily.

## How to Web Scrape with Python:

- Read through the website’s Terms and Conditions to understand how you can legally use the data. Most sites prohibit you from using the data for commercial purposes.

- Make sure you are not downloading data at too rapid a rate because this may break the website. You may potentially be blocked from the site as well.

## The advantages of web scraping: 

1. Automation

    - The first and most important benefit of web scraping is developing tools that have simplified data retrieval from different websites to only a few clicks.

2. Cost-Effective
   
    - Data extraction by hand is an expensive task that necessitates a large workforce and large budgets. Nonetheless, web scraping, like many other digital techniques, has solved this problem.

3. Easy Implementation
   
    - When a website scraping service begins gathering data, you should be confident that you are obtaining data from various websites, not just a single page. It is possible to have a large volume of data with a small investment to help you get the best out of that data.

4. Low Maintenance

5. Speed
    
    - Another feature worth mentioning is the speed with which web scraping services complete actions. Instead of doing the task in weeks it do it in hours.
    
6. Data Accuracy
    
    - Web scraping services are not only speed obsessive but also accurate. It’s a fact that human error is often a factor when performing a task manually, and that can lead to more serious problems later on. As a result, accurate data extraction for any type of information is critical.
