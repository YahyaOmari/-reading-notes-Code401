# Introduction to Machine Learning

- Machine Learning is making the computer learn from studying data and statistics.

- Machine Learning is a step into the direction of artificial intelligence (AI).

- Machine Learning is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome.

- The process of training machines; teaching computers to learn from data and detect patterns. It supports decision making.

- Consists of exploratory analysis(10%), data cleaning (20%), feature engineering(25%), algorithm selection(10%), and model training(15%).

### Data Types
- To analyze data, it is important to know what type of data we are dealing with.

- We can split the data types into three main categories:

1. Numerical.
2. Categorical.
3. Ordinal.


**Numerical** data are numbers, and can be split into two numerical categories:

- Discrete Data
1. Numbers that are limited to integers. Example: The number of cars passing by.
- Continuous Data
1. Numbers that are of infinite value. Example: The price of an item, or the size of an item.

**Categorical** data are values that cannot be measured up against each other. Example: a color value, or any yes/no values.

**Ordinal** data are like categorical data, but can be measured up against each other. Example: school grades where A is better than B and so on.

By knowing the data type of your data source, you will be able to know what technique to use when analyzing them.
