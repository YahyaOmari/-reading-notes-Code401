# Intro to Django

### What is Django?

- Django is a highly popular, free open-source high-level Python web framework. It follows the MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture and helps in the development and maintenance of high quality web applications. The primary reason for its popularity is its encouragement for rapid development with the help of pragmatic design. This fully featured server-side web framework eases the web development process and eventually helps in the saving you a lot of time. It also involves less coding which is another benefit for the developers.

### Django’s History?

### What does Django code look like?

- URLs: A URL mapper is used to redirect HTTP requests to the appropriate view based on the request URL. The URL mapper can also match particular patterns of strings or digits that appear in a URL and pass these to a view function as data.

- View: A view is a request handler function, which receives HTTP requests and returns HTTP responses.

- Models: Models are Python objects that define the structure of an application’s data, and provide mechanisms to manage (add, modify, delete) and query records in the database.

- Templates: A template is a text file defining the structure or layout of a file (such as an HTML page), with placeholders used to represent actual content.
