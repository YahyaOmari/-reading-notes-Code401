# Linear Regression

### Regression
- The term regression is used when you try to find the relationship between variables.

- In Machine Learning, and in statistical modeling, that relationship is used to predict the outcome of future events.

### Linear Regression
- Linear regression uses the relationship between the data-points to draw a straight line through all them.

- This line can be used to predict future values.

### How Does it Work?
- Python has methods for finding a relationship between data-points and to draw a line of linear regression. We will show you how to use these methods instead of going through the mathematic formula.
