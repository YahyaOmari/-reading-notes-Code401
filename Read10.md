# Stacks and Queues

## What is Stacks and Queues?
- They are the earliest data structure defined in programming. 
- A queue follows FIFO rule(First in First Out) and used in programming for sorting. It is common for stacks and queues to be implemented with an array or linked list.

-  Stacks follow these concepts:

## FILO
- First In Last Out
    - This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

## LIFO
- Last In First Out

    -This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

## A queue 
- Is a FIFO data structure: First-In First-Out in other words, it is used to implement a first come first served approach. An item that is added (enqueue) at the end of a queue will be the last one to be accessed (dequeue).

## A stack 
- Is a FILO data structure: First-In Last-Out. Imagine a stack of books piled up on a table. When you add (push) a book on top of the pile, it will be the first book that you will then take (pop) from the pile (stack).
