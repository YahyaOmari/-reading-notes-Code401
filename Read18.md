# Cryptography

## Introduction to Cryptography

- Cryptography requires two steps: encryption and decryption. The encryption process uses a cipher in order to encrypt plaintext and turn it into ciphertext. Decryption, on the other hand, applies that same cipher to turn the ciphertext back into plaintext.
- Encryption: scrambling the data according to a secret key (in this case, the alphabet shift).
- Decryption : recovering the original data from scrambled data by using the secret key.

## Caesar cipher
- In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar’s cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar’s code, or Caesar shift is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques

- Example:

- The transformation can be represented by aligning two alphabets; the cipher alphabet is the plain alphabet rotated left or right by some number of positions. For instance, here is a Caesar cipher using a left rotation of three places, equivalent to a right shift of 23 (the shift parameter is used as the key):

1. Plain: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ 
2. Cipher: XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW
