# Classes and Objects

- Python is an object oriented programming language.

- Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.

- A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

## Create a Class
- To create a class, use the keyword class:

- - class ExampleClass:

## Create Object
- Now we can use the class named ExampleClass to create objects:

- - p1 = ExampleClass()

## The __init__() Function

The examples above are classes and objects in their simplest form, and are not really useful in real life applications.

To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init __() function.

All classes have a function called __init __(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.

Use the __init __() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created.

> The __ init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.
