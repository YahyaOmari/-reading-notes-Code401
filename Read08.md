# List Comprehension

- List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.
- It consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for or if clauses. The expressions can be anything, meaning you can put in all kinds of objects in lists.

## The Syntax
 - newlist = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]
