# Big O Notation

## What Big O does? 

> It helps to determine the time as well as space complexity of the algorithm. When we use Big O notation, the time taken by the algorithm and the space required to run the algorithm can be ascertained.

### I will mention some of the lists of common computing times of algorithms in order of performance are as follows:
1. O (1).
- It describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.

2. O (n^2).
- It represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. This is common with algorithms that involve nested iterations over the data set.

3. O (n).
- It describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set. 

4. O (2^n).
- It denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set.
