# Linked Lists

- Linked List: A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list. 
- - Every node has 2 parts: data and a pointer to the next Node.
- It is also a sequence of data elements, which are connected together via links. Each data element contains a connection to another data element in form of a pointer. Python does not have linked lists in its standard library.
- Always the first node is the root one.
