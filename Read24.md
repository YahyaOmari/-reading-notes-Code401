# Hash Tables

### What is a hash table?

- Hash tables are a type of data structure in which the address or the index value of the data element is generated from a hash function. That makes accessing the data faster as the index value behaves as a key for the data value. ... In Python, the Dictionary data types represent the implementation of hash tables.

- A hash table is a special collection that is used to store key-value items. So instead of storing just one value like the stack, array list and queue, the hash table stores 2 values. These 2 values form an element of the hash table. Below are some example of how values of a hash table might look like.

### How do you use hash?

- Python offers hash() method to encode the data into unrecognizable value. Parameters : obj : The object which we need to convert into hash. Returns : Returns the hashed value if possible.

### Why do we need hash tables?

- A hash table is a data structure that is used to store keys/value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array in which an element will be inserted or searched. Under reasonable assumptions, the average time required to search for an element in a hash table is O(1).
